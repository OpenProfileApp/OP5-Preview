When customizing your scheme, replace all in capital
letters with your own custom value based on the text.
Do not include the parenthesis outside of " ", " as
part of your final scheme file. When ready, remove
all text inside parenthesis including the parenthesis
themselves and delete these paragraphs. Good luck!
