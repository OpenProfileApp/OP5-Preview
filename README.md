# OpenProfile 5 Preview
OP5 is an upcoming collaborative cross-platform application for writers, producers, and role-players to share minds and create diverse characters using an immensely advanced and FREE character profile template. For fandoms and authors, we even have a public database in the works that would enable users to learn more about your characters and the universe that goes around them!

WARNING: THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO STABLE RELEASES AS OF THIS TIMEFRAME. THIS IS A JUST PREVIEW VERSION AND IS EXPECTED TO HAVE ROUGH EDGES - NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PRODUCTION WORK.
